  ## Description
  - This project was created to develop a Node.JS program that generates a logo.svg file from user input based on prompts in the terminal. This program teaches how to create our own packages and install them into a JS file. It also taught me how to write files with the inquirer and fs packages. we also had to use jest and learned how to create tests for our code. this can be found in the shapes.test.js file.

  ## Installation
  - This project requires the installation of: node.js version 18, inquirer package version 8.2.4, fs package, validate-color package, and Jest package. 

  ## Usage
  - To use this app first open the correct terminal for this application. 
  - initiate via 'npm init -y'
  - install required packages via 'npm i < package name >' repeat for all packages. 
  - run 'node index.JS' 
  - answer prompts and create a logo.svg file.
  - To run a test, type 'npm test' or 'npm run test' in the terminal
